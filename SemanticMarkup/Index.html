        Let's look at some images:
        <img src="images/kitten.jpg" />
        <!-- title for next item -->
        <h4><span style="font-size:x-large">Cats Are Awesome!</span></h4>
        <!-- description of next item -->
        Look at this one:
        <img src="images/doggo.jpg" />
        <!-- add appropriate image here (don't forget alt attribute!) -->
        <!-- title for next item -->
        <h5><span style="font-size:x-large">Doggos Are Pretty Cool Too</span></h5>
        <!-- description of next item -->
        This doggo is a tricky doggo:

<!-- title for next section -->
<section><br />Sometimes people say important things.<br />
<!-- description of next section -->
You need to document important things that people say so you can sound smart when it's necessary.</section>

<br />When it comes to HTML, there are some things you just <span style="font-weight:700">shouldn't</span> do.<br />
<!-- description -->
<br />At least, not anymore...<br />

<!-- title for next item -->
<br />Want <span style="font-weight:700">bold</span> text?<br />
<!-- make 'right way' bold first the wrong way, then the right way -->
There's a <span style="font-weight:700;">wrong way</span> and a right way. <br />Always use the <span style="font-weight:700;">right way!</span><br />

<!-- title for next item -->
<br />Maybe you need some italics?<br />
<!-- make 'like this' italic using the wrong method. Make 'right way' italic using the correct method -->
<br />Again, it used to be done like this. <span style="font-style:italic;">This is wrong.</span> This is the <span style="font-style:italic;">right way.</span><br />

<!-- title for next item -->
<br />Separation of concerns<br />
<!-- description -->
<br />The wrong way tags above are deprecated and should not be used.<br /> <br />HTML should be used to mark-up or organize your content.<br /> <br />It should not be used to style your content or interact with it.<br /> <br />Those are the jobs of <span style="font-weight:700">CSS</span> and <span style="font-weight:700">JavaScript!</span><br />

<!-- title for next section -->
Links
<br /><a>http://www.espn.com/</a><br />
<!-- make either 'place' in the next body of text a link to your favorite site. (keep it appropriate) -->
<br />Links are one of the most important parts of the web.<br /> <br />They help you navigate from place to place on the internet.<br />

<!-- title for next section -->
<span style="font-weight:700"><span style="font-style:italic">Sections</span></span>
<!-- go back through and group each section correctly
     stretch: give each group a class that properly reflects what they represent -->
<br />Section elements are good for grouping elements that belong together.<br /><br />You can also use div's for this.<br />
